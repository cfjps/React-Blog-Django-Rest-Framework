# React-Blog-Django-Rest-Framework
The Net Ninja recently released a series about creating a Blog in React. Here I integrate his frontend with a Django Rest Framework handling the API calls.
His channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg

To start using this application:
Cd to the requirements.txt file and run the following in cmd/terminal pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Run python manage.py runserver
Open localhost:8000 in a browser.

Django Rest Framwork for the api calls.
Also used DjangoCorsHeaders for POST/DELETE.
